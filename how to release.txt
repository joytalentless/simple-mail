Prerequisite:

You need GPG installed (comes along with GIT installation in the \bin folder) and you need to create a keyring, used for signing artifacts.
If you have an existing key, simply import it:

gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import <keyring>.gpg

To release:

 1. update release notes and github readme page (don't commit)
 2. remove SNAPSHOT version
 3. mvn -DperformRelease=true clean deploy
            (set password in settings.xml or use local pgp key password, for which the public key must have been sent to a public key server,
            eg: gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys 05AC6403)
		    server needed in settings.xml (see below)
 4. add new SNAPSHOT version and commit everything
 5. Go to https://oss.sonatype.org and release the artifact so it is submitted to Maven Central

maven's settings.xml:

    <server>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <username>sonatype user</username>
      <password>sonatype password</password>
    </server>

To have a global gpg password so that it will use that automatically:

	<profiles>
		<profile>
			<id>gpg</id>
			<properties>
				<gpg.executable>gpg</gpg.executable>
				<gpg.passphrase>letmein</gpg.passphrase>
			</properties>
		</profile>
	</profiles>
	<activeProfiles>
		<activeProfile>gpg</activeProfile>
	</activeProfiles>
