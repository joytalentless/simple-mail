# Simple Java Mail #

Simple Java Mail is the simplest to use lightweight mailing library for Java, while being able to send complex emails including attachments, embedded images, custom headers and properties, address validation and even DKIM signing. Just send your emails without dealing with RFC's.

The Simple Java Mail library essentially is a wrapper around the JavaMail smtp mailing API that allows users to define emails on a high abstraction level without having to deal with mumbo jumbo such a 'multipart' and 'mimemessage'.

### [simplejavamail.org](http://www.simplejavamail.org) ###

```java
Email email = new Email.Builder()
    .from("lollypop", "lolly.pop@somemail.com")
    .replyTo("lollypop", "lolly.pop@othermail.com")
    .to("C. Cane", "candycane@candyshop.org")
    .cc("C. Bo", "chocobo@candyshop.org")
    .subject("hey")
    .text("We should meet up! ;)")
    .textHTML("<img src='cid:wink1'><b>We should meet up!</b><img src='cid:wink2'>")
    .embedImage("wink1", imageByteArray, "image/png")
    .embedImage("wink2", imageDatesource)
    .addAttachment("invitation", pdfByteArray, "application/pdf")
    .addAttachment("dresscode", odfDatasource)
    .signWithDomainKey(privateKeyData, "somemail.com", "selector")
    .build();

new Mailer().sendMail(email);
```
